# Project Brief: Vietnam Fast Visa Service

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A mobile-first urgent Vietnam visa application service targeting tourists who discover at airport check-in that they need pre-approval for Vietnam entry.

**Primary Problem:** Tourists, particularly those in Bali traveling to Vietnam, mistakenly believe "Visa on Arrival" means no preparation is needed. They're blocked at check-in and desperately search for fast solutions.

**Target Market:** Tourists at Southeast Asian airports (starting with Bali) who face imminent trip cancellation due to missing Vietnam visa documentation.

**Key Value Proposition:** Guaranteed 1.5-hour visa approval at $149 - the fastest guaranteed service at the best price in the market, with the best mobile UX and WhatsApp-native support.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

Vietnam's visa system creates significant confusion for tourists:

1. **Terminology Confusion:** "Visa on Arrival" (VOA) sounds like no preparation is needed, but travelers must obtain a pre-approval letter before arriving
2. **Official E-Visa Timing:** Standard government e-visa processing takes 3 working days, but can extend to 5-15 days during peak periods
3. **Discovery Point:** Many tourists only learn about this requirement at airline check-in, 2-4 hours before their flight
4. **High Stakes:** Without a visa, travelers face trip cancellation, lost hotel bookings, and potentially thousands of dollars in wasted expenses

### Impact of the Problem

- **Financial:** Tourists risk losing $1,000-5,000+ in non-refundable bookings
- **Emotional:** Extreme stress and panic at the airport
- **Time-Critical:** Only 1-3 hours to find a solution before missing their flight

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor Issue | Impact |
|------------------|--------|
| Price opacity | Fastest options require "contact us" - wastes precious time |
| Poor mobile UX | Clunky forms on desktop-designed sites |
| Unreliable speed claims | "15-30 minutes" advertised but not guaranteed |
| No weekend service | MyVietnamVisa doesn't process fastest tier on weekends |
| Slow response times | Email-based support when customers need instant help |

### Urgency

This is a growing problem as:

- Vietnam tourism is increasing post-pandemic
- More budget travelers book trips without thorough visa research
- Bali-to-Vietnam is a popular route with high confusion rates

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

A **mobile-first, WhatsApp-native urgent visa service** that:

1. **Guarantees 1.5-hour processing** with money-back if missed
2. **Operates via WhatsApp + web chat** for instant communication
3. **Shows transparent pricing** upfront ($149, no hidden fees)
4. **Provides real-time status tracking** to reduce customer anxiety
5. **Targets Bali market first** with airport-specific messaging

### Key Differentiators

| Factor | Our Service | Competitors |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Processing Time | 1.5 hours guaranteed | 2-4 hours (unguaranteed) |
| Price | $149 | $235-250 |
| Mobile UX | Best-in-class | Poor/outdated |
| Contact Method | WhatsApp + Chat | Forms + Email |
| Transparency | Full price shown | Hidden fastest tier pricing |
| Guarantee | Money-back if late | Varies |

### Why This Will Succeed

1. **Trusted Partner:** Direct relationship with tested Vietnamese visa office
2. **Speed Advantage:** 1.5 hours vs competitors' 2+ hours
3. **Price Advantage:** 40% cheaper than premium competitors
4. **UX Advantage:** Mobile-first when customers are on phones at airports
5. **Niche Focus:** Bali-specific targeting vs generic global approach

## Marketing Strategy

### Geo-Targeted Airport Advertising

**Core Strategy:** Show ads ONLY to people physically at the airport using precise geo-targeting.

**Platforms:**

| Platform | Geo-Targeting Capability | Best For |
|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| **Google Ads** | Radius targeting (1km around airport) | Search intent - "urgent Vietnam visa" |
| **Facebook/Instagram** | Location targeting by coordinates | Visual ads, awareness |

**Target Location:** Ngurah Rai International Airport (Bali)
- Coordinates: -8.7467, 115.1667
- Radius: 1-2 km (covers terminals + parking)

**Ad Timing:**
- 24/7 (flights depart all hours)
- Increase bids during peak departure times

**Google Ads Strategy:**
- Keywords: "urgent Vietnam visa", "fast Vietnam visa", "Vietnam visa now", "Vietnam visa 1 hour"
- Location: Ngurah Rai Airport only
- Device: Mobile only (people are on phones)
- Ad copy: "Vietnam Visa in 1.5 Hours - Guaranteed. $149. Get Approved Before Your Flight."

**Facebook/Instagram Strategy:**
- Location: People "currently in" airport area
- Interest: Travel, Vietnam, Southeast Asia travel
- Ad creative: "Stuck at check-in? Vietnam visa in 90 minutes"
- CTA: WhatsApp direct link

**Advantages of Airport-Only Targeting:**
1. **Ultra-high intent** - People at airport need solution NOW
2. **Low competition** - Competitors target broadly, you target precisely
3. **Lower cost** - Smaller audience = lower total spend
4. **Higher conversion** - Desperate customers convert fast
5. **Measurable ROI** - Direct correlation between ad spend and sales

**Estimated Budget:**
- Start with $20-50/day
- Scale based on conversion data
- Expected CPC: $2-5 for airport-targeted mobile searches

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Exact search volume for "urgent Vietnam visa" + variations
- Google Ads CPC for target keywords
- Bali hotel/hostel partnership feasibility
- Competitor actual delivery times (mystery shopping)
- Legal requirements for operating visa agency
